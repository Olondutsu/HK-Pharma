# SET-UP / Installation Guide

For optimization matter, there is just the Assets File so you have to follow next Steps

1) Download Unity Latest Version or whatever, who care ? Well, it is better for Button's compatibility due to use of TextMeshPro

2) Create a New Project with 2D Template

3) Replace your brand new Assets folder with the one from the Git

4) Once in Unity, just goes to Scenes folder and open MainScene

5) CHECK IT OUT, tho there is nothing interesting

# WHAT'S NEXT ?

- Make Item In Slot draggable + OnMouseExit Inventory = Replace Sprite + Add Draggable & ItemStats Scripts + Store Interactions

- <Strike> Add heating and freezing logic for each container according to currentTemperature (+ Home insulation ??)</Strike>

- DO A BETTER PARTICLE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE WANT IT FANCY BRO ( Soft Body or Particles or Sprite w/ RigidBody + Collider (??)

- Create a new list in container that tell how much quantity of items are within (then make different recipe out of this for different quality of any products)

- Add an event system and dialogue box for the main story, scenario, dialogues etc

- Add some global parameters as Global Tension, Wanted level and Partisans

- Add complete recipes 

- Scenario Writing

- ArtWorks (+ Anim ?)

- Add music + sound design

- Repair the whole fucking mess

AND THEN... >>>> DO A PLAYABLE DEMO, OPEN A PATREON, GET MONEY, PUT ON STEAM, GOES TO GUANTANAMO
