# SET-UP / Installation Guide

For optimization matter, there is just the Assets File so you have to follow next Steps

1) Download Unity Latest Version or whatever, who care ? Well, it is better for Button's compatibility due to use of TextMeshPro

2) Create a New Project with 2D Template

3) Replace your brand new Assets folder with the one from the Git

4) Once in Unity, just goes to Scenes folder and open MainScene

5) CHECK IT OUT, tho there is nothing interesting
